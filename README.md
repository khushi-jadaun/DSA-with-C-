Time Complexity
Rate at which time taken increases with respect to input size
It is of three types:-
1. Worst Case Scenario(Big 0 Notation)
In this we will take the maximum time taken by the code to get execute
2. Average Case scenario(Theta Notation)
average time taken by the code to execute
3. Best case Scenario (Omega Notation)
Minimum time taken by the code


In maximum cases, we have to find out the worst case scenario; Big O notation
